When I started working on my adaptation of Frankenstein, my goal was to reinterpret Victor Frankenstein’s narrative in a way that would feel relevant to a modern audience. The themes of scientific advancement and ethical responsibility in the novel are especially relevant today, given how quickly technology is advancing and all the questions that come with it. To explore these connections, I created a website that captures Victor’s thoughts, reflections, and the consequences of his actions. I chose to use a website because it represents a technological advancement that didn’t exist in Victor’s time. While Victor’s experiments were confined to his laboratory, a website is able to share and store information with anyone. 

The homepage sets the tone for the website by giving a sneak peek into Victor’s mindset as a brilliant but flawed scientist. It has a dark, dramatic design that highlights the themes of scientific exploration and its consequences. The opening statement hopefully triggers curiosity and slight discomfort in the users to reflect the darker outcomes of Victor’s work.

The Research Entries page gives the user a look into Victor’s experimental process, styled to feel like the notes of a mad scientist. The page has scattered, overlapping entries with ripped corners, stains, and scribbled annotations, creating the sense that the notes were quickly put together. The sketches and incomplete observations add to the disorganized theme, reflecting Victor’s obsession and how his ambition starts to get out of control.

The Ethical Reflections page is meant to showcase Victor’s guilt and self-awareness, focusing on his struggles with morality, responsibility, and the consequences of his actions. The page has crumpled balls of paper scattered across the screen. When you click on a ball, it "unwraps" to reveal a thought Victor might have had about the ethics of his experiments. I created the page like this to show that Victor may have briefly considered these ethical questions but ultimately crumpled them up and threw them away due to his obsession with scientific progress. 

The Elizabeth’s Letters page gives a personal look at how Victor’s obsession affected the people who cared about him. Through her letters, Elizabeth displays the emotional impact of his choices and how his absence hurt those around him. I added thought bubbles to each letter to show Victor’s reactions. The thought bubbles in red show how he initially ignored her concerns. While the thought bubbles in green show his regret later on. This contrast helps highlight the human cost of his ambition, showing how his decisions impacted more than just himself.

The Headlines of Horror page displays a collection of newspaper clippings pinned to a bulletin board, as if Victor had cut them out and arranged them himself. The clippings document the consequences of his experiment. This layout gives the sense that Victor was keeping track of the destruction he caused, maybe as a way of confronting his guilt or trying to make sense of it all. 

The final page introduces a futuristic AI system called Chronos. It is developed centuries after Victor’s death to analyze human history. Since Victor is no longer alive to tell his story, Chronos has used historical records to piece together consequences of his actions. The AI then distributes these cautionary messages as if they were coming from Victor himself. It serves as Victor’s voice from the future, delivering the warnings he never gave in his lifetime. This page creates a connection between Viktor’s story and the ethical challenges of modern scientific advancements.
