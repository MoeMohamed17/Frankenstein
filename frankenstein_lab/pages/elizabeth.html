                These letters, written by Elizabeth, linger in my mind. They reveal not only her love but the cost of my obsession, which I refused to acknowledge until it was too late.

            <!-- Letter 1 -->

                    My dearest Victor,
                    <br><br>
                    Your absence is a constant ache in my heart. You bury yourself in your studies, chasing secrets I cannot fathom. I fear that this pursuit consumes you. Do you not see the toll it takes, not only on you but on those who love you?
                    <br><br>
                    Please, Victor, remember that life is more than ambition. It is connection, family, and love. I beg of you to write to me and assure me of your well-being.
                    <br><br>
                    Yours always,<br>Elizabeth

                    At the time: "Her concerns were distractions from my purpose. What is love compared to science?"
                </div>
                <div class="thought-bubble regretful">
                    Now: "How blind I was. Science without compassion creates not progress, but ruin. She was right, I let ambition devour everything I cherished."

                <div class="reader-question">
                    <strong>What would you do?</strong> Would you risk the love of those closest to you for the pursuit of discovery?

                    Victor,
                    <br><br>
                    It has been months since I last heard from you. Is it science that keeps you away, or have you forgotten the warmth of home? I fear your silence almost as much as I fear what you might be doing in that secluded study of yours.
                    <br><br>
                    Have you paused to consider the consequences of your work? Can something born of secrecy and isolation bring anything but sorrow? I miss you, Victor. Please return to us.
                    <br><br>
                    Yours,<br>Elizabeth
                </p>
                <div class="thought-bubble dismissive">
                    At the time: "Secrecy is the price of greatness. She cannot understand the magnitude of my work or the risks I must take."

                <div class="thought-bubble regretful">
                    Now: "Secrecy shielded me from judgment but also from wisdom. If I had shared my burden, would I have avoided disaster?"

                <div class="reader-question">
                    <strong>What would you do?</strong> Should groundbreaking science be conducted in isolation, or does it need accountability?

                    Dearest Victor,
                    <br><br>
                    The world feels colder without you. Your ambition has taken you far from those who love you. I do not know what you have created or what it means for the world, but I know it has stolen you from me.
                    <br><br>
                    Is there still a spark of love in your heart? I beg of you, write back. Return to the life you left behind before it is too late.
                    <br><br>
                    With hope,<br>Elizabeth

                <div class="thought-bubble dismissive">
                    At the time: "I told myself I would return after proving my greatness. But could I truly return to her with the weight of what I had done?"

                <div class="thought-bubble regretful">
                    Now: "My silence was cowardice. I had betrayed her love and her trust, and in doing so, I sealed my own despair."

                <div class="reader-question">
                    <strong>What would you do?</strong> Would you face the consequences of your actions, or bury yourself deeper in your work?

                    Victor,
                    <br><br>
                    Your father told me of your increasing isolation, your refusal to return home, and your unyielding fixation on your "work." Victor, what have you done? What have you sacrificed?
                    <br><br>
                    I once admired your ambition, but now I see it as a fire that burns everything it touches. Will you ever stop? Or will we lose you entirely?
                    <br><br>
                    With a heavy heart,<br>Elizabeth

                <div class="thought-bubble regretful">
                    Now: "Her words were a warning I refused to hear. My ambition hurt her, and now I am left with regret."
