                Greetings, traveler. I am Chronos, an AI designed to archive and analyze humanity's history and scientific achievements. Through my analysis of Victor Frankenstein's life, I have identified troubling similarities that threaten humanity's future. These warnings are sent to you from the future, as a guide to avoid repeating his mistakes.

            <!-- Warning Items -->
            <div class="warning" data-log="001" data-message="The act of creating life is not yours to claim. Victor Frankenstein dared to defy nature, stitching together life from death. Yet, in granting life, he failed to grant responsibility. The creature was abandoned, left to suffer, and humanity paid the price for his negligence. To create life is to bear its weight, not to discard it.">
                <p class="warning-title"><strong>[Log #001: The Act of Creation]</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="warning" data-log="003" data-message="You cannot control what you create. Frankenstein sought to build perfection but gave rise to chaos. Once life is created, it cannot be controlled or undone. The creature defied its creator, proving that life is not a tool to be manipulated. Those who play god risk being undone by their own hands.">
                <p class="warning-title"><strong>[Log #002: Control]</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="warning" data-log="004" data-message="The ethics of creation matter as much as the act itself. To create life is not merely a question of ability but of morality. Victor created his creature in secrecy, without thought for its well-being. Science without ethics is a dangerous force, one that history warns against repeating.">
                <p class="warning-title"><strong>[Log #003: Ethics]</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="warning" data-log="005" data-message="Loneliness and rejection breed monsters. Victor’s refusal to accept his creation drove it to violence. The creature’s pain was not born of evil, but of isolation. Those who create must take responsibility for the emotional lives of their creations.">
                <p class="warning-title"><strong>[Log #004: Loneliness]</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="warning" data-log="006" data-message="One act can change the course of history. Victor’s creation, though singular, sparked waves of fear, death, and loss that altered the lives of countless others. Every choice has a ripple effect, consider the unintended consequences of your advancements.">

            </div>
            <div class="warning" data-log="007" data-message="The future records every decision made in the present. Through my analysis, I have seen countless iterations of humanity's progress—many of which end in devastation. Take these warnings as a chance to rewrite history and avoid a grim fate.">
